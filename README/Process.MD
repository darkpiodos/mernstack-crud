create a model

and export module

create middleware configuration
create a separate route
create a controllers

Its a success | I can now finally upload and retrieve images

Now here are the things need to polish in this backend:

1. Code Structure & Organization
   A clean and organized structure makes the code easier to maintain.

-Separate folders for controllers, models, routes, middlewares, and services.
-Environment Variables: Move sensitive values (e.g., database URI, secret keys) to a .env file.

2. Error Handling & Validation
   Proper error handling makes your API more reliable.

-Express Error Middleware: Create a custom error handler for consistent error responses.
-Input Validation: Use Joi or express-validator to validate incoming data.

3. Security Improvements

   -Helmet: For setting secure HTTP headers.
   -Rate Limiting: To prevent brute force or DDoS attacks
   -Sanitize Input: To avoid NoSQL injection attacks using express-mongo-sanitize

4. File Uploads
   Since youâ€™ve just added file upload functionality:

-File Size Limit: Restrict the file size for uploads.
-File Validation: Ensure only images (jpg, png) are accepted.
-Serve Uploaded Files Securely: Avoid serving uploads directly without checking authorization if needed.

5. API Documentation
   Helps others (or future you!) understand how to use your API.

-Use Swagger or Postman to document your endpoints

6. Authentication & Authorization
   If your project will have users:

-Add JWT-based Authentication for secure access.
-Protect certain routes for authenticated users only.

7. Database Improvements
   -Use Mongoose Middleware for pre/post actions like validation or logging.
   -Add Indexes for frequently queried fields to improve performance.
   -Consider pagination for large datasets.

8. Logging & Monitoring
   -Use morgan for HTTP request logging during development.
   -Add proper logging for errors and database operations with a library like winston.

9. Deployment Preparation
   When ready for production:

-Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Configure CORS if connecting to a frontend.
-Optimize for Cloud Deployment: Consider Docker and CI/CD pipelines for scalability.

10. Testing
    -Add tests for your routes and controllers using Jest or Mocha/Chai.
    -This ensures your API works as expected after changes.
